You can help Angular \n  to track which items added or removed by providing a <code>trackBy</code> function which takes the index and the current item as arguments and needs to \n  return the unique identifier for this item.</p> <p>For example, lets set <code>trackBy</code> to the <code>trackByTodos()</code> method</p> \n  <pre><code class="language-javascript">\n  &lt;div *ngFor="let todo of todos; trackBy: trackByTodos"&gt; ({{todo.id}}) {{todo.name}} &lt;/div&gt; \n  </code></pre> \n  <p>and define the <code>trackByTodos</code> method,</p> \n  <pre><code class="language-javascript">\n  trackByTodos(index: number, item: Todo): number { return todo.id; } \n  </code></pre>'},{slug:"ngcc",question:"What is ngcc?",answer:'<h3 id="ngcc">What is ngcc?</h3>\n    \n    <p>The ngcc(Angular Compatibility Compiler) is a tool which upgrades node_module compiled with non-ivy ngc into ivy compliant format.
