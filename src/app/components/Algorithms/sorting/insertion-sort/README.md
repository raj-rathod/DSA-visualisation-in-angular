### What is Insertion Sort ?

>Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works similar to the way you sort playing cards in your hands. The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part. Values from the unsorted part are picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted part

### Insertion Sort Flowchart 
- Iterate from arr[1] to arr[N] over the array
- Compare the current element (key) to its predecessor
- If the key element is smaller than its predecessor, compare it to the elements before. Move the greater elements one position up to  make space for the swapped element
