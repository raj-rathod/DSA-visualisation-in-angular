> DSA Visualization is a project on **data structures and algorithms**. In this project all points of data structures and algorithms like as working approach, properties, operations, applications, advantages and disadvantages are well explained and visualize the operations for better understanding.

### What is Linked List?

>A linked list is a linear data structure as well as a dynamic data structure.A linked list consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and reference(address) to the next node in the list

### Linked List Types
- **Single Linked List:** A single linked list is the most common type of linked list. Each node have data and an address field that contains a reference to the next node
- **Double Linked List:** In the double linked list, there are three fields that are the previous pointer, that contain a reference to the previous node.Then there is the data, and last you have the next pointer, that containes a reference to the next node. Thus you can go in both direction
- **Circular Linked List:** The circular linked listis extremely similar to the single linked list. The only difference is that the last node is connected with first node, forming a circular loop in the circular linked list

### Linked List Operations
- Insertion
- Deletion
- Sort
- Search
