> DSA Visualization is a project on **data structures and algorithms**. In this project all points of data structures and algorithms like as working approach, properties, operations, applications, advantages and disadvantages are well explained and visualize the operations for better understanding.

### What is hash table?
>A hash table is a type of data structure that stores key-value pairs. The key is sent to a hash function that performs arithmetic operations on it. The result (commonly called the hash value or hash) is the index of the key-value pair in the hash table.

### What is the hashing?
>Hashing is a technique which uses less key comparisons and searches the element in O(n) time in the worst case and in an average case it will be done in O(1) time

### What is the hash function?
>Hash function: As weâ€™ve already seen, the hash function determines the index of our key-value pair. Choosing an efficient hash function is a crucial part of creating a good hash table. You should always ensure that itâ€™s a one-way function, i.e., the key cannot be retrieved from the hash. Another property of a good hash function is that it avoids producing the same hash for different keys
