> DSA Visualization is a project on **data structures and algorithms**. In this project all points of data structures and algorithms like as working approach, properties, operations, applications, advantages and disadvantages are well explained and visualize the operations for better understanding.

### What is the avl tree ?

>An AVL tree in data structure is a binary tree that is self-balanced by checking the balance factor of every node. It means that the height of the left subtree and the right subtree is balanced. The balance factor should either be -1, 0, or 1. The maximum height difference between the left and right sub-trees can only be 1. In case, the difference is greater than 1, then we must re-balance the tree to make it valid using rotation techniques

### Tree Operations
- Insert Node
- Delete Node
- Height of the Tree
- Find Node
- Levels of the Tree
- Tree Traversal
- Rotation
