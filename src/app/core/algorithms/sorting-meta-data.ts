    `Loop through the unsorted array and perform the following:
      </br> (i) Calculate bucketIndex bucketIndex = (array[i] - minimum) / range 
      </br> (ii) Insert the ith element of the array into the bucket[bucketIndex]`,
    `Sort the individual buckets`,
    `Gather all the elements together`
  ],
  properties:[
    `Bucket sort assumes that the input is drawn from a uniform distribution`,
    `The computational complexity estimates involve the number of buckets`,
    `Bucket sort can be exceptionally fast because of the way elements are assigned to buckets, 
      typically using an array where the index is the value`,
    `This means that more auxiliary memory is required for the buckets at the cost of running time than more comparison sorts`
  ],
  applications:[
    `Uniformly Distributed data`,
    `Floating point numbers between range 0.0 to 1.0.`,
    `Bucket Sort is a very different type of sorting algorithm as it does not involve direct comparison between 
      the numbers. It can only be applied to uniformly distributed data`,
    `Whenever we have floating-point numbers between 0 and 1, bucket sort might be the best sorting approach. 
      Reason - if we use merge-sort, quick-sort, heap-sort, etc, the problem will take a minimum of O(nlogn) 
      time complexity. Also, counting sort cannot be used because floating point numbers cannot be used as index. 
      Hence, bucket sort is best suited for sorting the array with floating point numbers of range [0.0-1.0]`
  ],
  advantages:[
    `Bucket sort allows each bucket to be processed independently. As a result, youâ€™ll frequently need to 
      sort much smaller arrays as a secondary step after sorting the main array`,
    `Bucket sort also has the advantage of being able to be used as an external sorting algorithm. 
      If you need to sort a list that is too large to fit in memory, you may stream it through RAM, 
      split the contents into buckets saved in external files, and then sort each file separately in RAM`,
  ],
  disadvantages:[
    `The problem is that if the buckets are distributed incorrectly, you may wind up spending a lot of extra 
      effort for no or very little gain. As a result, bucket sort works best when the data is more or 
      less evenly distributed, or when there is a smart technique to pick the buckets given a fast 
      set of heuristics based on the input array`,
    `Canâ€™t apply it to all data types since a suitable bucketing technique is required. Bucket sortâ€™s 
      efficiency is dependent on the distribution of the input values, thus itâ€™s not worth it if your
      data are closely grouped.In many situations, you might achieve greater performance by using a 
      specialized sorting algorithm like radix sort, counting sort, or burst sort instead of bucket sort`,
    `Bucket sortâ€™s performance is determined by the number of buckets used, which may need some additional 
      performance adjustment when compared to other algorithms`
  ],
  performance:[
    `<b>Worst Case Time Complexity: O(N**2)</b> </br> If the array elements are not uniformly distributed, 
      i.e., elements are concentrated within specific ranges. This will result in one or more buckets having 
      more elements than other buckets, making bucket sort like any other sorting technique, where every element 
      is compared to the other. Time complexity increases even further if the elements in the array are present 
      in the reverse order. If insertion sort is used, the worst-case time complexity can go up to O(N**2)`,
    `<b>Best Case Time Complexity: O(N+K)</b> </br> If the array elements are uniformly distributed, 
      bucket size will almost be the same for all the buckets. Hence, this will be the best case which 
      will take up the least amount of time. Sorting time complexity will reduce even further if all 
      the elements inside each bucket are already sorted. To create n buckets and scatter each element 
      from the array, time complexity = O(n). If we use Insertion sort to sort each bucket, time complexity = O(k). 
      Hence, best case time complexity for bucket sort = O(n+k), where n = number of elements, and k = number of buckets`,
    `<b>Average Case Time Complexity: O(N)</b> </br> It occurs when the elements are distributed randomly in the array.
      Even if the elements are not distributed uniformly, bucket sort runs in linear time. It holds true until the 
      sum of the squares of the bucket sizes is linear in the total number of elements`,
    `<b>Space Complexity : O(N+K)</b> </br> Space Complexity for bucket sort is O(n+k), where n = number of elements 
      in the array, and k = number of buckets formed Space taken by each bucket is O(k), and inside each bucket, 
      we have n elements scattered. Hence, the space complexity becomes O(n+k)`
